	<p>Impressed? This can be accomplished easily using the <a href='/documentation/animate.html'>animate</a> and <a href='/documentation/event.html'>event</a> functions. Play about, try to recreate it.

	<h3>So what are you waiting for?</h3>
	
	<p><a href='/download.html'>Download Spark</a>, read the <a href='/documentation.html'>documentation</a> and maybe even the <a href='/assets/downloads/SparkGuide.pdf'>Spark guide</a>. Then get coding amazing web apps. Good luck and have fun doing what you do best.</p>
