	<h3>Learn by example</h3>
	
	<p>I feel the best way for you to get started with Spark is to see it in action. You may have noticed the tweets on the right sneaking in there, well that was Spark, but try clicking this box below for another demonstration.</p>
	
	<div id='lbe'><p>Pretty cool, if I do say so my self.</p></div>
	
	<p>Impressed? This can be accomplished easily using the <a href='/documentation/animate.html'>animate</a> and <a href='/documentation/event.html'>event</a> functions. Play about, try to recreate it. Once you create a nice effect or function, why not turn it into a plugin and share it with other users.</p>
	
	<p>Here is another example. Say you wanted to toggle the visibility of all list items on the page when you clicked a button. You could use this code below.</p>
	
	<script src="https://gist.github.com/903349.js?file=SparkExample.js"></script>
	
	<p>Spark doesn't just handle shiny animated elements though. It also does the leg work in the background. For example, the tweets on the right are loaded by this line and passed into a function to display them. This is all done using the JSONP function.</p>

	<h3>So what are you waiting for?</h3>
	
	<p><a href='/download.html'>Download Spark</a>, read the <a href='/documentation.html'>documentation</a> and maybe even the <a href='/assets/downloads/SparkGuide.pdf'>Spark guide</a>. Then get coding amazing web apps. Good luck and have fun doing what you do best.</p>
